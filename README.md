Overwatch Telegram Notifier
===========================

Overwatch is a monitoring system â€“ see [github.com/messa/ow2](https://github.com/messa/ow2). It provides a GraphQL endpoint.

This script reads data from that GraphQL endpoint about currently opened alerts and sends a message to a specific Telegram group whenever a new alert is opened or an alert is closed.
